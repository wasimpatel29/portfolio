            <p>
                In my professional experience till now I have played multiple roles such as application architect, project lead, subject
                matter expert, full stack developer, infrastructure planning, team building, software craftman. My domain
                area is more into auto finance and banking. I have strong foundational knowledge of Java/J2EE technologies,
                I have build many applications with vast architecture and development skills. I am a cloud certified and
                deeply understand the modern cloud technologies for application needs. I have migrated many legacy or outdated
                technology applications into modern technologies. In recent years I have mastered in spring framework and
                re-engineered monolith applications into microservices and also developed application with modern needs such
                as continuous integration, continuous delivery, test driven development, automated integration test, deployment
                pipelines, cloud native applications, circuit breakers, blue green deployment, red green refactor and the
                list will go on. I dont compromise on quality, so the work delivered by me will be unit tested, integration/performance
                tests passed and I will make sure the application follows 12-factor app methodology.
