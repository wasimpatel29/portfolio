                        Since young age I had much interest in computers and eager to pursue my career into it. Leaning towards my goal,
                        I acquired bachelors degree in computer engineering from University of Pune.

                        In my final year I was campus recruited by Syntel and started working there after my graduation as analyst
                        programmer. During my journey with Syntel, I got ample opportunity to work in application development, migrate applications (paid
                        to open source), architecture design, re-engineering projects which gave me adequate knowledge to take next challenge.

                        My next hop as a software consultant with major US auto finance company. I was hired to migrate and redesign outdated payments system to newer modern technologies. 
                        Over the time I gained expert knowledge in api development, webservices, microservices, pivotal cloud, angular 2, spring, ci/cd, agile, mobile apps,
                        test driven development, cloud native design. The experience here matured me as a software craftsman and I was ready for next level.

                        My next move with Capgemini as a technical manager came with lots of responsibility. As a consulting partner we are working with major
